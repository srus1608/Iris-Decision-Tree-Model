### Iris Classification Using Decision Tree
## Overview
This project implements a Decision Tree model to classify Iris flower species based on the Iris dataset.
The dataset includes measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three different Iris species.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of the following features:

1. Sepal.Length: Length of the sepal (in cm)
2. Sepal.Width: Width of the sepal (in cm)
3. Petal.Length: Length of the petal (in cm)
4. Petal.Width: Width of the petal (in cm)
5. Species: The species of the Iris flower (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica)
   
The model is trained and tested on these features using a Decision Tree classifier.

## Installation
To run the notebook, ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. You can install the necessary libraries using:
pip install -r requirements.txt

The requirements.txt file should include:

1. pandas
2. numpy
3. scikit-learn
4. matplotlib
5. seaborn

## Usage
Clone the repository:
git clone https://[github.com/yourusername/iris-classification-decision-tree](https://github.com/srus1608/Iris-Decision-Tree-Model).git

cd iris-classification-decision-tree

Place your dataset in the data/ directory.

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook decision-tree.ipynb

Run the notebook to train and test the Decision Tree model on the Iris dataset. The notebook also includes visualizations to help understand the decision boundaries.

## Model
The Decision Tree model is trained on the Iris dataset and evaluated based on its accuracy in classifying the species. The model's decision boundaries are visualized to demonstrate its performance.

## Results
The model is evaluated using accuracy, and the decision boundaries are visualized in the notebook.
